## Overview
This project demonstrates a full digital investigation process in a simulated scenario. The goal was to collect, analyse, and report evidence from multiple devices to reconstruct events.

I designed this lab to practice hands-on digital forensics, combining both technical analysis and structured documentation skills.

## Tools Used
- Autopsy
- Wireshark
- Volatility
- Network Miner
- Sleuth Kit
- rip.pl

## Objectives
- Preserve and analyse disk images and memory dumps
- Investigate network captures
- Recover deleted or hidden data
- Reconstruct the sequence of events in a timeline
- Document findings clearly

---

## Methodology
1. Collected disk and memory images from simulated endpoints
2. Analysed network traffic and system logs
3. Recovered deleted and hidden files
4. Identified key artefacts and connected events in a timeline

## Findings
- [Insert high-level findings here, e.g., malware detected, suspicious files, evidence of a breach]
- [Summarise reconstructed events]
